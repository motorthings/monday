# Create Board (Platform MCP)

Creates a new monday.com board in a specified workspace with configurable visibility, description, and ownership using the Platform MCP.

Use this tool to create a new board in your monday.com account. You can specify the board's name, visibility kind (`public`, `private`, or `share`), an optional description, the target workspace, and one or more board owners. If no workspace is provided, the board is created in your default workspace.

A board is the primary container for organizing work in monday.com. Once created, you can add groups, columns, and items to it using the `create_group`, `create_column`, and `create_item` tools.

# 

Parameters

Parameter| Type| Required| Description  
---|---|---|---  
boardName| `string`| Yes| The display name of the new board.  
boardKind| `string`| No| Visibility level of the board. One of `public`, `private`, or `share`. Defaults to `public`.  
boardDescription| `string`| No| A short description of the board's purpose.  
workspaceId| `string`| No| The ID of the workspace to create the board in. Use `list_workspaces` to discover workspace IDs.  
boardOwnerIds| `array`| No| List of user IDs to set as board owners. Use `list_users_and_teams` to look up user IDs.  
  
# 

Example

Create a public project tracking board in workspace `12406666`:

JSON
    
    
    {
      "boardName": "MCP Docs Test Board",
      "boardKind": "public",
      "boardDescription": "Temporary board for MCP tool documentation testing",
      "workspaceId": "12406666"
    }

The tool returned board ID `18412502536`, a name, and a direct URL to the board: `https://monday.monday.com/boards/18412502536`.

Programmatic equivalent

Use the [GraphQL API](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/reference/boards#create-a-board) to achieve the same result:

GraphQL
    
    
    mutation {
      create_board(
        board_name: "MCP Docs Test Board"
        board_kind: public
        workspace_id: 12406666
        description: "Temporary board for MCP tool documentation testing"
      ) {
        id
        name
        url
      }
    }
